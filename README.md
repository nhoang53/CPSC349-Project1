The following are suggestions for the team to work in similar fasion.

- Copy and paste from pages already approved by the rest of the team as a good template. This way the style of the pages do not differ from eachother as much.
- If you create a function that might be useful in other parts of the project added to the shared.js file that way we can use said function.
